### Navier-Stokes equations
The following two partial differential equations characterize fluids. Our goal is to solve these equations to simulate the behaviour of fluids.
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -(u \cdot \nabla) u+\nu \nabla^2 u+\mathbf{f}$$
$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -(u \cdot \nabla) \rho+\kappa \nabla^2 \rho+S$$
